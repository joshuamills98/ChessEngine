# <center> **Overview** </center>
Welcome to my chess engine project. This project was developed as part of my MSc in Computer Science.
The purpose of the engine is to simulate a chess game when provided with a series of moves.
`ChessMain.cpp` shows an example game - the format of each move is given in long form notation (e.g. "A7H6" describes moving a piece from A7 to H6)

## <center> **How to Use** </center>

To run the chess program
1. Clone this repository
2. Enter this directory and `make` the relative files
3. run `./bin/chess`

The program should run the chess game provided by `ChessMain.cpp` in the terminal. An example output is shown below:
